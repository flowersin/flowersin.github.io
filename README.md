# Ellie's Website

## About

This is the source code for my personal website, [ems7d4.com](ems7d4.com).  I built this website to better my understanding of the web, as well as to document my other projects.  This site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to build the html from markdown files, making editing and adding content a breeze.  This website also uses the Jekyll theme [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy), which look fantastic.  Thank you to the devs of both of these projects!

Everything here has been written by yours truly.  I hope you enjoy!

## Development Setup

Install ruby and bundler, then clone this repo.  Navigate to the root directory of the repo, and run `bundle install` to install the nessecary software.

## Testing Locally

Run `bundle exec jekyll s` to host a local web server.
Visit [127.0.0.1:4000](127.0.0.1:4000) to view the site!
Most changes will update automatically, but changes to `/_config.yml` will require you to restart the local web server.

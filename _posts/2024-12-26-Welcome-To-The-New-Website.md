# Why?  

With this post going live, my website [ems7d4.com](https://ems7d4.com) has been completely re-built from the ground up.  Previously, I had written every page by hand in the spirit of web1.0, but this was tedious and got in the way of sharing what I wanted to share.  With the update I hope to add content with much greater frequency and ease, and shift the website to a method for sharing information on my other projects rather than a project iself.

# How?
Previously, my website consisted of a handful of html files that lived in [my github pages repository](https://github.com/flowersin/flowersin.github.io).
Now, I use the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate the actual html for me while I write the pages in markdown.  This keeps me from having to write html for every page, which was time consuming and frustrating.
To set up and configure Jekyll, I followed [github's guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll) on setting up github pages with Jekyll.
To make everything look beautiful, I used the Jekyll theme [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) and [their wiki](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started/).

	<h2><a href="https://pitchfork.com/">Pitchfork</a></h2>
	<ol>
		<li>My first impression  of Pitchfork's website was it'd design was pleasant.  The first place my eyes went was to the articles and related photographs, which seems intentional.</li>
		<li>The website has a heading at the top of the page, and keeps it's content centered both while reading articles and browsing articles.</li>
		<li>The website's layout was easy to intuit, from the home page you can either select a featured article or navigate to different categories such as "News," "Reviews," and others. The pages for each category are laid out identically to eachother and the homepage, making naviagtion a breeze.</li>
		<li>I feel that the graphics, layout and multimedia of the website enhance the articles and reading experience.  They guide your attention and build associations before picking an article, but don't distract from the reading.</li>
		<li>The homepage took around a second to load, mostly due to the images and other multimedia used to show off each article.  I felt like this was reasonably quick and it didn't take longer than I would expect.</li>
		<li>I feel like the color and font choices are a wonderful choice for a reading-heavy website.  Clean black and white, I don't think it gets much better than this.</li>
		<li>The naviagtion bar reflects the website's minimal structure.  The naviagtion options can guide you to the seven different category pages, and it feels adequite and deliberately minimlaistic in a way that feels well-done.</li>
		<li>The black and white color scheme felt great on all pages.</li>
		<li>The site handled odd window sizes well while keeping everything readable.  Shrinking the window horizontally smoothly changed the website to a more mobile-focused design that felt just as well thought out.</li>
		<li>I felt like the simple style and color pallet really made this website feel great to explore and read.</li>

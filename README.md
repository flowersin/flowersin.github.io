# Ellie's Website
This is the source code for my personal website, ems7d4.com.  I built this website to develop a better understanding of HTML/CSS with the intention to make an early web-inspired personal website.  Everything here has been written by yours truly, no AI or copying templates.  
I am constantly making tweaks as I learn new things and take on new challenges, primarily when time permits.  
Made with love, by Ellie.

    "content": "Why?With this post going live, my website ems7d4.com has been completely re-built from the ground up.  Previously, I had written every page by hand in the spirit of web1.0, but this was tedious and got in the way of sharing what I wanted to share.  With the update I hope to add content with much greater frequency and ease, and shift the website to a method for sharing information on my other projects rather than a project iself.How?Previously, my website consisted of a handful of html files that lived in my github pages repository.Now, I use the static site generator Jekyll to generate the actual html for me while I write the pages in markdown.  This keeps me from having to write html for every page, which was time consuming and frustrating.To set up and configure Jekyll, I followed githubâ€™s guide on setting up github pages with Jekyll.To make everything look beautiful, I used the Jekyll theme Chirpy and their wiki."

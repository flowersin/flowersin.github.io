# About This Website
Currently, I write all of my "content" in markdown.  Then, I build the site with <a href="">Eleventy</a> locally and published to <a href="https://github.com/flowersin/flowersin.github.io">Github</a> for hosting.  I've done all of the writing by and templates myself, but Eleventy helps automate the process and is so much simpler.  If you haven't looked at it before, I would definitely recommend it over Jekyll or writing your HTML by hand.  I've had personally experience with both, and both SUCK.
## Future Plans
- I'd like to move to a different domain, as I prefer my flowersin alias over ems7d4.
- I'd like to add more content about my homelab and linux setups!  At some point, I'd like to create more informative or instructional content as well.

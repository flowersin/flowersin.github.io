Hello!  Welcome to my website!
My name is Ellie Schaefer, I use She/Her pronouns.
By day I am a cybersecurity student and job coach for individuals with disabilities.  By night I am a maker, linux enthusiast and avid learner. I post my projects, write-ups and anything else I feel worthy of sharing here when time permits.
When I'm not studying, working or behind the keyboard I love to read, play Dungeons and Dragons, ride my bicycle and drink tea.
